# SOLID
  - S -> Single Principle
    - A Model must have one, and only one, reason to change
  - O -> Open-Closed Principle
  - L -> Liskov Substituion Principle
    - Liskov Substitution Principle states:
        Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
        This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
  - I -> Interface Segregation Principle
  - D -> Dependency Inversion Principle
    - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
